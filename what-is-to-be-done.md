Now here is what has to be done:

1. The side panel:

The highlight of the actice page has to match the gray highlight exactly as seen on reference pdf /finalPdf.pdf
The button that opens and closes the side panel has to match OpenAI's as on the reference PDF. The button has a round square with a vertical line that moves a third of the spave to the right when the panel is opened and reverts farther to the left when the panel is closed. 
The page has to "recentralize" content when the side pane is opened. The padding between side panel and left of page content has to match the padding between the right margin(of screen) and the right of page content. It should adjust smoothly. 

2. Page content: 
Must be centralized whether panel is opened or not. 
Must match the appeal EXACTLY as on the reference pdf. I will upload logos for the partners area and you have to put our logo also on top of the panel just as OpenAI's as shown on the pdf. 
As you can see on the reference pdf, there is no black thing at the botton but a light background footer. That is what you have to implement and remove the black thing. 
Please, match this landing page with what is on the PDF.

INSTRUCTION:

Look at the pdf critically and match the look of it on our landing page, I mean, EXACTLY minding everything I have told you.
Make sure everything is visible
Now this is critical: In the same writing style and tone, you have to remove openAI's text and put ours. You will perhaps create content from the SirkupAI Information as given in the file /sirkuai-info.md
THINK CRITICALLY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING! THINK!!!

You have to reference yet unexisting files in code that I am gonna put in /public/... so that the app can pick them app for the app logo as well as partners logo as well as pictures for thee various content on the page wich we do not have. You will give me names to put to the files which will be in the project folders to rename them so that they are picked by the code.I hope you understand. 

Come up with a plan on how you intend to carry this out!
